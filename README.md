### ðŸŸ¦ StateMachine with Transition Builder
A State Machine is a computational model used to design systems that can be in one of a finite number of specific states at any given time, transitions between these states is defined by fixed rules which are based on user-input, external or internal events.  
In context of 

**Features:-**
- Define States as either as separate objects or as callback methods.
- Separate State initialization and disposal logic.
- A Global State to account for situations when an entity stops to exists, such as character death.
- State transition builder to easily define State transition conditions and rules in one place, rather than hard-coding them directly within the State objects themselves.

```
public class AI_Character : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        // StateMachine instance
        state_machine = new(this);

        // Create State instances
        combat_state = new(this);
        patrol_state = new(this);
        death_state  = new(this);

        // There are 2 ways to add a new State to StateMachine.

        // 1. Add State instances directly to StateMachine together a unique int ID for that State.
        state_machine.AddState(combat_state, COMBAT_STATE);
        state_machine.AddState(patrol_state, PATROL_STATE);

        // 2. For lightweight StateS such as an idle State, you can directly specify
        // Enter, Update and Exit methods, together with a unique int ID for the new State. 
        // Enter and Exit methods are optional.
        // The returned value of AddState is a new State object created internally.
        idle_state = state_machine.AddState(OnIdleUpdate, IDLE_STATE, enterMethodCallback:OnIdleEnter, exitMethodCallback:OnIdleExit);

        // To account for situations such as a character's death which must be honored regardless the current State, can be
        // done using a Global-State, together with a Global-State-Trigger which is just a callback function and
        // returns a bool value, the Global-State will trigger as soon as its trigger will return true.
        state_machine.AddGlobalState(death_state, triggerMethodCallback: IsAlive);

        // To switch to a different State 
        state_machine.SwitchState(IDLE_STATE);
		
        // The default order of execution is that, when a State transition is requested, the Exit-Method of current State is invoked,
        // followed by the Start-Method of new State, for complex initialization and disposal logic both Enter and Exit methods can
        // continue to execute as long as their return value is 'false', OnUpdate method starts after Start method return 'true'.
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        if(state_machine != null)
            state_machine.Update();
    }
}
